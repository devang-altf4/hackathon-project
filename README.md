This is a project that was given as a sollution to a problem statement in hackathon held in mithibai college in villey parle, where we had to:

Challenge: Build a Full-Stack Web/Mobile Application that:

Lists available recyclable materials (type, quantity, quality grade, location) from generators and recyclers

Matches suppliers with buyers using smart algorithms (price, location, material type, quality)

Tracks material provenance from collection to remanufacturing with blockchain-inspired transparency

Provides fair market pricing based on real-time demand and material specifications

Onboards informal waste workers with simplified digital wallets and transaction records

Includes SMS/WhatsApp notifications for low-connectivity users in Tier 3 areas

i solved this problem and created an web app which does this all , only problem is i cannot deploy it currently because of no free servers availabe at the moment , will deploy it later.
